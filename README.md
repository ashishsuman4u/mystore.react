# About MyStore

MyStore is a fictional ecommerce store which I have created for my blog.

# Data file used

https://github.com/PlatziLabs/fake-api-backend/tree/master/src/dataset
This is a awesome repository and api for development but I was facing issue as anyone can create and remove records using api and there is no way to get the default data from the api.

# Authentication & Database

I have used firebase store for managing cart/checkout session and firebase authentication for user management. For more information about those services, you can visit https://firebase.google.com/docs?hl=en

# Serverless functions & Deployment

I always love to use Vercel for deploying reactjs and nextjs projects. They have an awesome deployment pipeline which works perfectly for hobby and professional projects. In this project I have used their serverless functions as well. These functions are easy to write and test using the vercel cli. For more information about those services, you can visit https://vercel.com/docs/functions
