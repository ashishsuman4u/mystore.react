# About MyStore

MyStore is a fictional ecommerce store which I have created for my blog.

# Data file used

https://github.com/PlatziLabs/fake-api-backend/tree/master/src/dataset
This is a awesome repository and api for development but I was facing issue as anyone can create and remove records using api and there is no way to get the default data from the api.

# Database

I have planned to use firebase store for managing cart/checkout session and firebase authentication for user management.

# Deployment

I always love to use Vercel for deploying reactjs and nextjs projects. They have an awesome deployment pipeline which works perfectly for hobby and professional projects.
